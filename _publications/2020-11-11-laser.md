A model for 10.6 µm high energy laser beam interaction with a uniform, monodisperse cloud of water droplets is developed. The model includes droplet and vapor heating as well as droplet shattering in the “fast regime” as defined in Appl. Opt. 28, 3671 (1989). The cloud dynamics feed back on the laser via changes in the complex refractive index. In one space dimension, the model is solved exactly, including an explicit formula for the front of the cleared channel. Numerical simulations are conducted for the axisymmetric three-dimensional case. Model predictions and limitations are discussed.
